# Question:
You are given an array nums containing n distinct numbers taken from 0, 1, 2, ..., n.
Find the one number that is missing from the array.

Example:
  Input: nums = [3, 0, 1]
     Output: 2
  Input: nums = [0, 1]
     Output: 2

# Understanding:
The array should have all numbers from 0 to n, but one is gone.
We must figure out which one.

There are a few ways:
Brute force → check for every number (O(n²)) — not good.
Sorting → find the gap (O(n log n)) — better.
Math → sum(0…n) − sum(nums) = missing number (O(n)) — best.
XOR → XOR all indices and nums; remaining gives missing (O(n)) — cool trick.
We’ll use the math approach — clean and fast.

@ Code:
def missingNumber(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    expected_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
    actual_sum = sum(nums)
    return expected_sum - actual_sum


# Example Run
nums = [3, 0, 1]
print("Missing number:", missingNumber(nums))


##Explanation
.If numbers from 0 to n were complete, their sum would be n*(n+1)/2.
.We calculate what we actually got (sum of array).
.The difference = the missing number.
.Simple math, no loops beyond sum().
    Time complexity: O(n)
   Space complexity: O(1)

##Pro Tip
For large datasets or streaming input, prefer the XOR method since it doesn’t rely on integer overflow and uses bitwise ops:

def missingNumber_XOR(nums):
    xor_all = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        xor_all ^= i ^ num
    xor_all ^= len(nums)
    return xor_all


Super efficient and immune to overflow issues.
