## 🌟 About This Challenge
Every day for **365 days**, I will:
- 💻 Solve one **DSA problem**
- 📝 Write a short journal entry about my approach
- ⏳ Analyze time & space complexity
- 📂 Share both **code** & **thought process** here

This is not just a coding routine — it’s a **discipline challenge** to improve problem-solving skills and build a valuable resource for learners.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Strengthen core **DSA concepts**
- Practice **clean, readable code**
- Learn by **consistency over intensity**
- Inspire others to start their own journey
